# Hello there!

This is my guide on how to set up my code! First install Microsoft's "Visual Studio Code".
Next, put my two files into a folder, name said folder whatever you want. Open the folder in
VSC and import pandas and plotly.express (You can do that in the inbuilt VSC terminal,
write "pip install pandas" and "pip install plotly.express" if you haven't installed them
already. Have you done all that? Great! Now run my code again and you're set! This is Open
Source so you can play around with the code, it's only 6 lines anyways! You can use your own
excel data and slap it on there, may be even use a diferent graph/plot type!

# Thanks for checking out my code!
